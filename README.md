# moos-ivp-jogama
Most of what I have here is in /missions and /src, and follows the labs for [2.680](http://oceanai.mit.edu/ivpman/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Lab.HomePage2680).  
The format of this directory is standard, and explained in /README  

To build, just run ```./build.sh``` if you've already installed moos-ivp as detailed [here](http://oceanai.mit.edu/ivpman/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Lab.MachineSetup) (it's easy, promise!).
